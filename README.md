# Features

1. Dynamic Cart System
   The beauty ecommerce website boasts a highly interactive and dynamic cart system. Users can effortlessly add products to their cart with just a click. The cart displays the selected items along with their respective quantities and prices. Users can also remove items from the cart, and the total price is updated in real-time. This seamless experience enhances user satisfaction and encourages higher conversion rates.
2. Local Storage Persistence
   One of the standout features of this website is its efficient use of local storage. This ensures that the selected items persist even after the page is reloaded or if the user navigates away from the site and returns later. The use of local storage provides a seamless and uninterrupted shopping experience, allowing users to pick up where they left off.
3. Prevention of Duplicate Items
   To streamline the shopping process, the application employs a mechanism that prevents the addition of duplicate products to the cart. If a user attempts to add an item that is already present, the quantity of that item is automatically incremented, ensuring an organized and clutter-free cart.
4. Detailed Product Information
   Each product in the ecommerce store is accompanied by detailed information, including product name, description, price, and an attractive image. This allows users to make informed decisions about their purchases, enhancing their overall shopping experience.
5. Responsive Design
   The website is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it is fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, users can enjoy a seamless and visually appealing browsing experience.
6. Stripe API Integration
   To facilitate secure and hassle-free transactions, the website is integrated with the Stripe API. This industry-leading payment gateway ensures that users' payment information is handled securely, providing peace of mind during the checkout process.
7. User-Friendly Navigation
   The website features an intuitive and user-friendly navigation system. Users can easily browse through different product categories, search for specific items, and access additional pages such as the cart and checkout with minimal effort.
8. Search Functionality
   A robust search functionality allows users to quickly locate specific products based on keywords or product names. This feature enhances user convenience and accelerates the shopping process.
9. User Authentication (Optional)
   For a personalized experience, the website can be extended to include user authentication functionality. This would enable users to create accounts, save their preferences, and view their order history.
